      <h1>Background</h1>
      <p>In January 2017 I graduated as a teacher in mathematics and
        physics at <a href="https://www.thomasmore.be/" target="_blank" class="link">Thomas More Mechelen</a>. Before even receiving my diploma,
        I started working as a teacher in mathematics at <a href="https://busleydenatheneum.be/campuspitzemburg" class="link" target="_blank">Busleyden
        Atheneum Pitzemburg</a> in Mechelen. There I was teaching kids
        from age eleven to fourteen their favourite course for one
        semester. Not feeling satisfied with the life as a teacher,
         I decided to start a new study in order to become a Game
         Developer. Three years later, here we are.</p>

      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <p>
        Games have always been a big part of my youth. I started playing
        Runescape when I was around 7 years old, learning English by
        communicating with everybody around the world. Not much long after
        games such as Battlefield 1942, Age of Empires received their rightful
        place on the list as well. These days only big story driven games like
        God of War, The Last of Us and Red Dead Redemption are worth my time playing.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I could not constantly play videogames. There had to be room for some
        creativity thinking as well. And that's where music comes into place. Inspired
        by my brother picking up the guitar, I decided to start playing the drums.
        Together we form a heavy-rock band called <a class="link" href="http://hyperurl.co/hofhorse" target="_blank" >The H of Horse</a>. Not too long ago, I
        picked up the guitar as well, to have some variation.
      </p>
      <p>
        While drums can be quite intense at times, there has to be some room for sports in my life as well.
        I'm a big fan of doing sports during the daily-life-routine. When something is do-able by
        bike, I usually grasp that oppurtunity. Alongside that I also try to lift
        the weights three times a week. This enables me maintaining a good posture
        after a long day(s) of sitting and get stronger along the way.
        Not only that, but it usually is the best cure against a bad day too.
