        <h2>The goal</h2>
        <p>Creating a couch game with a small team (4 people) by going through the typical
        production process. Design documents must be made, version control must be used and
        you have to learn how to work together with a team.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h2>The process</h2>
        <p>Every week each member of the group worked 10 hours on the project. The first two
        weeks our time was spend on prototyping. Trying to find out the theme and feel of the game
        we wanted to create. The next six weeks were spend on production. The bulk of the game was made
        during this period. The last two weeks were spend on polishing. Bug fixing, adding particle effects
        was mostly done during this period.

        <h2>My job and take aways</h2>
        <p>I designed and programmed most of the combat. Things like the hook weapon, the laser and the cannonballs.
        I was also in charge of the resource and power-up elements that are being dropped during the gameplay.
        The power-up elements are the chaos factors in this game. </p>
        <p>The biggest challenge during this project was mostly the planning. We cramped alot
        in a short amount of time which of course caused more bugs then we would like. It's better to drop a few things
        and have a finished product than a lot of things and a broken product.</p>
